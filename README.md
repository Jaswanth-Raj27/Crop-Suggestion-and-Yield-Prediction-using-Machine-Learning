Crop-Suggestion-and-Yield-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Predicts the best crop and its expected yield using real agricultural data, powered by Flask and machine learning.

This project is a simple yet effective machine learning application that predicts the most suitable crop for given soil and weather conditions and estimates the expected yield (in tons per acre).  
It combines data science and agriculture to help farmers and researchers make informed decisions about what to grow and what yield to expect.

Overview
The system takes various environmental and soil parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, along with location details like state, district, soil type, and pest problems.  
Using this data, it predicts:
1. The best crop that suits those conditions.
2. The approximate yield that can be expected for that crop.

The project is built around two core machine learning models:
Random Forest Classifier for predicting the type of crop.  
Random Forest Regressor for predicting the expected yield.

Both models are trained using a dataset of Indian agricultural data containing soil nutrients, environmental conditions, and yield values.  

The app uses Flask as the backend framework to connect the trained models with a simple web interface where users can enter their data and get instant results.
